# Free 3rd Party Controllers!

This `search_preview` controller has been an awesome example for us to learn how to
make great-looking, functional things in Stimulus. But I have a confession:
we didn't *really* need to do all this work! Why? Because someone already created
an open source autocomplete Stimulus controller!

## Hello stimulus-autocomplete!

Head to https://yarnpkg.com and search for "stimulus". You'll actually find a lot
of Stimulus tools here that you can look through. What we're looking for is called
[stimulus-autocomplete](https://github.com/afcapel/stimulus-autocomplete). Here
it is. Head to GitHub for find its documentation. Ooh! A GIF! Or.. GIF! This
looks like *exactly* what we want!

## Hello stimulus-components!

Before we implement this package, this is just one of *many* pre-made Stimulus
controllers that exists out there. Let's take a quick tour-de-tools!

First up is
[Stimulus Components](https://stimulus-components.netlify.app/docs/components/index/):
a collection of a *bunch* of controllers... each with a fancy demo! Let's pick a
random one - how about this Lightbox controller - and click into its demo. Yup!
If you need to display photos in a Lightbox, there's a pre-made controller for
that!

## Hello TailwindCSS Stimulus Components!

If you use Tailwind CSS, check out the
[TailwindCSS Stimulus Components](https://github.com/excid3/tailwindcss-stimulus-components).
It *also* has a demo with fun stuff inside, like a slide over, modals, tab
functionality down here and more.

## Hello stimulus-hotkeys!

Want to add keyboard shortcuts to your Stimulus controller? There's a tool for
that: [stimulus-hotkeys](https://github.com/leastbad/stimulus-hotkeys).

## Hello stimulus-flatpickr

What about a date picker? Try the
[stimulus-flatpickr](https://github.com/adrienpoly/stimulus-flatpickr) controller,
which integrates the [flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/) JavaScript library.

And... that's not even everything! You can check out the
[Awesome Stimulus](https://github.com/skatkov/awesome-stimulusjs) GitHub resource
for more libraries, reading, podcasts, etc about Stimulus.

## Hello BetterStimulus.com

One last interesting resource is [betterstimulus.com](https://www.betterstimulus.com/),
which holds a bunch of interesting patterns and best practices around Stimulus.

## Installing stimulus-autocomplete

*Anyways*, let's get back to integrating this autocomplete controller. First, we
need to install it! Copy the "yarn add" command, find your terminal and run:

```terminal
yarn add stimulus-autocomplete --dev
```

## Registering 3rd Party Controllers

So... once this finishes... how are we going to actually *use* this new controller?
When we add a file to the `assets/controllers/` directory, Stimulus automatically
registers that as a controller, which means we can add a matching `data-controller`
element to the page and it *will* work. When we install a Symfony UX package, the
`controllers.json` does the same thing for *those* controllers.

[[[ code('c1d236640d') ]]]

But what about the controller that we just installed? How do we register *that* with
our Stimulus app? Back at the docs, under "Usage", you can see that they import
the `Autocomplete` package... then call some `application.register()` thing
to register this *one* controller.

But... which file should we add this code to? The answer is `assets/bootstrap.js`.
Notice that this looks *pretty* similar to the code example, though not
exactly the same. The `application` variable in the docs is the same as the `app`
variable that we have in our file.

[[[ code('14a57423c4') ]]]

On the docs, copy the `import` line and... pop that onto the top of our file. Then,
to register the controller, down here say: `app.register('autocomplete')` - that
name could be *anything*... and will determine the `data-controller` that will
be used to connect to this controller in HTML - then  `Autocomplete`.

[[[ code('05bb3e1c42') ]]]

Congratulations! With 1 command and 2 lines of code, we now have a new controller
called `autocomplete` available in our app!

Next: let's use this controller instead of our `search-preview` controller. It's
going to be, well, refreshingly easy to drop in. Also: can we make this third-party
controller load lazily... like we've done with some other controllers? Totally!
